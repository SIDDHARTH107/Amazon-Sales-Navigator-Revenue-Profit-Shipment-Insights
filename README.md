## Project Overview

This Tableau dashboard was designed to:

- Track profits by region and country

- Analyze revenue by sales channel (online vs offline)

- Visualize orders per year & by priority

- Measure average shipment days

- Identify top-performing and underperforming regions

- Provide drill-down capability for interactive exploration

## Business Problem

Sometimes stakeholders request a way to tackle the business requirements with the help of reports and dashboards:

- Analyze profits by regions and countries

- Understand channel revenue distribution

- Track orders per year and by priority

- Compare shipment days vs revenue trends

- Identify key drivers of sales performance

This required creating KPIs such as:

- Profit (Revenue – Cost)

- Orders per year

- Shipment days = Shipment Date – Order Date

## Key Features

- __KPI Tracking:__ Profit, Revenue, Shipment Days, Units Sold

- __Profit Analysis:__ By regions (bar chart) & by countries (map)

- __Sales Channel Analysis:__ Online vs Offline revenue split

- __Orders Analysis:__ Orders per year (line chart), orders by priority (bar chart)

- __Shipment Analysis:__ Shipment days vs revenue correlation

- __Interactivity:__ Click-to-filter across charts

## Industrial Methodology

- __Business Requirement Documentation or Requirement Gathering:__ Translating business objectives into KPIs

- __Wireframing:__ Blueprint of dashboard layout before building

- __Data Preparation:__ Creating new KPIs (profit, shipment days, order count)

- __Visualization Design:__

a) Bar charts for regional comparisons

b) Maps for country-level profit analysis

c) Line charts for time-based analysis

d) Donut/Pie charts for <=3 or 4 categories

- __Dashboard Development:__ Interactive filters, clean labels (no abbreviations), intuitive ordering, and then deployment or publishing to end users

## Some sample business insights from this dashboard:

- Revenue drops when shipment times increase

- Offline channels generate higher revenue than online

- Sub-Saharan Africa & Europe are top-performing regions

- Orders peaked in 2012 but gradually declined after 2014

- Shipment delays strongly correlate with reduced revenue
